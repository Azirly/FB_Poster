Goal Of FB_Poster:
--Be able to mass post to all FB groups that the users desires.
--If the user has access to a FB group, then he should be 
able to automatically post to the group at his own convenience.

Using Selenium:
	
	Good:
		-Got Input Working
		-Can now post into groups with relative ease
	
	
	Still Need:
		-Organize prototype
		-Be able to send to multiple groups
		

Will now ignore using Facebook API from now on.

Current Version: 6/11/2016

Using Facebook API:

-Finish up program so that it only posts to open groups.
-Groups that have privacy = "closed" will not allow me to
post on their groups, meaning that I have to find another
way to multi-post to groups
